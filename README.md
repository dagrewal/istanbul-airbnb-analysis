# An Analysis of Istanbul using airbnb Data

## Project Motivation
This analysis was completed as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. The dataset and business problems were chosen based on past experiences of visiting the city of Istanbul.

## Library Requirements
For a full list of all requirements to run the code in this repository, please see the requirements.txt file.

## Summary
Analysis was performed on opensource airbnb data for the city of Istanbul. Three questions were considered as aprt of the analysis:

1. Which side of the city has cheaper accommodation?
2. Which month of the year has the best deals on accommodation?
3. What do customers say in accommodation reviews?

Findings from the analysis can be found on Medium blog linked below.

This repository contains the code that was used to develop analysis for the Medium blog post https://medium.com/@d.grewal1503/how-to-choose-your-accommodation-on-your-next-airbnb-getaway-7e0711eae51b. Data has not been uploaded due to size restrictions. However the data can be downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and then used as input for the Code/DataPrep.ipynb file to produce the datasets used in the analysis files.

Some pieces of code have been copied and adapted for use from other published resources such as https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-sentiment-analysis-a38bf1906483 and https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/automated-keyword-extraction-from-articles-using-nlp-bfd864f41b34. Where this is the case, it has been stated in the docstring of the relevant functions.
