# An Analysis of Istanbul using airbnb Data
This repository contains the code that was used to develop analysis for the Medium blog post https://medium.com/@d.grewal1503/how-to-choose-your-accommodation-on-your-next-airbnb-getaway-7e0711eae51b. Data has not been uploaded due to size. However this can be downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and then used as input for the Code/DataPrep.ipynb file to produce the datasets used in the analysis files.

Some pieces of code have been copied and adapted for use from other published resources such as https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-sentiment-analysis-a38bf1906483 and https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/automated-keyword-extraction-from-articles-using-nlp-bfd864f41b34.
