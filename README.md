# An Analysis of Istanbul using airbnb Data
<hr>
This repository contains the code that was used to develop analysis for the Medium blog post. Data has not been uploaded due to size. However this can be downloaded from [insideairbnb](# http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and then used as input for the Code/DataPrep.ipynb file to produce the datasets used in the analysis files.
