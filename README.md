# An Analysis of Istanbul using airbnb Data
This repository contains the code that was used to develop analysis for the Medium blog post. Data has not been uploaded due to size. However this can be downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and then used as input for the Code/DataPrep.ipynb file to produce the datasets used in the analysis files.

Some pieces of code have been copied and adapted for use from other published resources such as https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-sentiment-analysis-a38bf1906483 and https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/automated-keyword-extraction-from-articles-using-nlp-bfd864f41b34.
